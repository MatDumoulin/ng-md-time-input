# NgMd
This project is an open-source duration input for Angular Material. Feel free to contribute to make this library even more awesome!
This project runs on Angular and Angular Material 6.0.0. It is not compatible with older version of Angular.

## Development server
Everytime the ng-md-time-input library is changed, you must build the library first before testing it with ng serve. To do so, run `npm run build`.
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. As mentionned, if anything in the `projects/ng-md-time-input` folder was changed, you must first build it in order to see the changes.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to run a development build of the ng-md-time-input library. The build artifacts will be stored in the `project/` directory. Use the `npm run build-prod` for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm run test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
